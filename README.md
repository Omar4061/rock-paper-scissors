# Rock Paper Scissors – (Console only)

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game implemented in JavaScript as part of the [Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) from **The Odin Project**.

## How It Works

- The game is played in the browser console.
- You play **5 rounds** against the computer.
- Each round:
  - You are prompted to enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
  - The computer randomly selects its choice.
  - The result of the round is printed to the console.
- At the end, the game announces the **final winner** based on total scores.

## What I Learned

- Basic JavaScript functions and control flow
- User input with `prompt()`
- Random value generation
- Working with loops and conditionals
- Structuring code with helper and nested functions

## How to Play

1. Open the developer console in your browser (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
2. Run the script.
3. Follow the prompt inputs to play 5 rounds.
4. Check the console to see the result of each round and the final winner.
